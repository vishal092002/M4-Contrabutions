<table><tr><td> <em>Instructions: </em> <p>Each week I&#39;ll record your contributions to the class/group following the same outline.
You&#39;ll export this assignment to markdown (or download it as a markdown file) and add it to your group&#39;s Github.
You&#39;ll want to change the file name to include your ucid so it doesn&#39;t conflict with anyone else&#39;s files if it&#39;s in the same directory.</p>
<p>It&#39;s required to keep this branch in sync with all team members each module/week (you shouldn&#39;t cause anyone to lose their work).

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I kept on getting an error when I was running apt-get install syslog-ng<br>syslog-ng-core so instead I had to use sudo apt-get install syslog-ng -y&nbsp;&nbsp;and it<br>worked. The above screenshot was taken when I figured out the error and<br>tried the other command because my VM&#39;s connection was reset due to inactivity<br>so I was not able to screenshot the errors.&nbsp;<div><br></div><br></p><br></td></tr>
